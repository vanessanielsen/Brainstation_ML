# Predicting Hair Salon No-Shows

### No-shows are a big problem for hair salons. They decrease revenue and increase wait times.

### ML Applied to a Small Business

"No-shows" i.e. customers who don't show up for their scheduled appointment, are a problem for companies who need to schedule 
in clients. This is particularly problematic for the service industry (salons, restaurants, beauty) and the healthcare industry
(lab testing, dentists, therapists). No-shows cost a business money and increase wait times. Research shows there are patterns
among no-show customers and particular customers are more likely to skip appointments than others. However, little is still known
about the people who miss appoints and effective strategies for managing them.

One small business, a hair salon in Toronto, was experiencing particularly high rates of missed appointments. They released a
year's worth of appointment data to Kaggle, hoping that insights could be uncovered that would help them identify the cause
and reduce the number of missed appointments.
